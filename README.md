# The-Lean-Webserver

This project was created for my Parallel & Distributed Computing class in Uni. I talked with my professor to conclude on a project idea. Since my professor was familiar with the book Computer Systems - A Programmer's Perspective, being the one who translated it in Greek, and I had gone over it since it's a great book, we concluded on an exercises from the relevant threading chapter, specifically 12.38.

In the mentioned chapter, the Tiny HTTP webserver was introduced to show a simple example of an HTTP server implementation.The task of my project was to write a prethreading implementation to help balance out the load of the website. My project also has some benchmarks to showcase different results.

Shout out to my man [Lean](https://github.com/TasosY2K) for being a great name inspiration. Also expect this as a pwn challenge sometime maybe idk.
